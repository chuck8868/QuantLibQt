Swaption pricing in Libor Market Model(LMM)
Submitter: vanna	Date: 2007/3/31
Description: 
This file contains C++ code/GNU Scientific Library to perform Monte Carlo simulation for calculating price of an European swaption under the Libor Market Model (LMM) framework.
It is based on Milstein scheme discretization as described in page 82 of Lecture Notes

Results are tested with LFM approximation formula , which is further compared to Table2 data in Linking Caplet and Swaption Volatilities in a BGM/J Framework: Approximate Solutions
(Fine tuning is required on dt parameter. Decreasing it below 0.05 seems to bring in precision errors, while making it higher seems to give lower swaption values.Brigo's book recommends to use refined variance scheme to improve convergence, but is not implemented in this file)

eg., following result were obtained with parameters in this file:


Swap start = 2.5 year
Swap end = 7 year
SR=0.0651932
swaption price = 2.22793
Press any key to continue . . .


following results are obtained with setting these parameters in file LFM approximation formula:
alpha=6; %start peg of swap
beta=15; %end peg of swap


octave:137> lmm_rebonato
SR = 0.065193
var_sum = 0.069366
swap start=2.500000 
swap end=7.000000 
swaption price=2.238223


Note: The file has been updated to fix issue of compiling problem with new version of Dev C++ 4.9.9.2
